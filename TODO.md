# bumpCversion
Development of a version bump utility to use with a C repository that uses semantic
pre-processor version definitions.

### 'To Do' List
- [ ] How do you create an .exe from a .py file?
- [ ] Create command line interface and add support for arguments.
   - example: `$> bumpCversion (version_file_path) (major|minor|patch)`
- [ ] Bump version number in Doxyfile also.
   - Maybe we can choose which regex to use by file extension type.
- [ ] Are configuration files needed?
- [ ] Is support for other scripting a good feature?
   - i.e., script to check for content in 'unreleased' changelog section.
